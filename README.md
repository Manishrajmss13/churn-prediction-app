# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN (TensorFlow + Streamlit)

An end-to-end Deep Learning project predicting **customer churn** using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).  
The app is trained, evaluated, and deployed using TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit Cloud.

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the bank) based on demographics and account information.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled categorical encoding (Label + OneHot), scaling, and train-test split.  
2. **Model Building:** Implemented an **Artificial Neural Network** using TensorFlow/Keras.  
3. **Model Evaluation:** Used accuracy, confusion matrix, and prediction thresholds.  
4. **Deployment:** Integrated model into a **Streamlit app** with real-time input fields.
